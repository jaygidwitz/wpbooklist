== Screenshots ==

1. How your books will appear on your website. WPBookList uses most of the default styling of your currently active theme, but <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/stylepaks-2/">WPBookList StylePaks</a> allow you to further customize WPBookList styling to better suite your website. 
2. Another shot of the same website - note the review stars!

5. How individual books can look with the <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/storefront-extension/">StoreFront Extension</a>’ - here you see several purchase links and the price displayed, and you’ll notice that the ‘Finished’, ‘Signed’, and ‘First Edition’ text is hidden.
6. An example of how the Amazon Reviews look for each title.
7. A screenshot of the ‘Description’ and ‘Notes’ section for each title, both of which are fully editable.
8. Another example of a different book.
9. A screenshot of the options page in the WordPress Dashboard. Here you can control which elements actually get displayed on the page you’ve placed your library on.
10. Here you can create additional libraries, for example, you could create a ‘Currently Reading’ library, a ‘Fiction’ library, a ‘Fantasy’ library, or whatever else you can think of!
11. With the <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/affiliate-extension/"> Affiliates Extension</a>, you can add your Amazon & iTunes Affiliate ID to each book, giving you credit each time a visitor clicks on and/or purchases a title.
12. Here’s a screenshot of where you can upload your WPBookList StylePaks, changing the look and feel of WPBookList.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I add a book?** - On the WordPress Dashboard, click on the ‘WPBookList’ link on the left-hand side (marked by a circular icon outlined in orange). Fill out the form, click ‘Add Book’, and that’s it! If you choose to gather book info from Amazon, the only required field is the ISBN/ASIN number. 

**I’m an author and/or publishing company - can I link to Author’s Websites?** - You sure can! If you’ve purchased the <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/storefront-extension/">StoreFront Extension</a>, then when adding a book, you’ll be given the option to input the Author’s URL, and you’ll then see a link to that URL when viewing that title.

**Can I use WPBookList to sell my books?** You can with the <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/storefront-extension/">StoreFront Extension</a>! While WPBookList doesn’t sell books directly, it can be used to link to wherever your books are sold, and display that link, and the price of the title, to your visitors, both in the Library view and the individual Book view. This is only possible with the <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/storefront-extension/">StoreFront Extension</a>. <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/storefront-demo/">Check out the StoreFront demo here.</a>

**Can I add my own Amazon Affiliate ID to all my books in WPBookList?** - Absolutely, but only <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/affiliate-extension/">with the Affiliates Extension</a>.

**I’m a publisher/author looking for unique advertising opportunities - do you offer advertising space in WPBookList?** I do! I’m currently looking to populate WPBookList with  some ‘default’ titles that will come pre-installed when the user first activates WPBookList, and I also have a method of pushing out books to individual websites for all to see. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:advertising@wpbooklist.com">Advertising@WPBookList.com</a> for more info.

**Why can't WPBookList find my book?** - While WPBookList will have no problem finding the vast majority of books by their ISBN/ASIN numbers alone, occasionally WPBookList will come across a title that it simply can't find information for. WPBookList searches through the databases of Amazon, Google, iTunes, and more for information about a title, so the general rule of thumb is that if it can't be found at amazon.com or Google Books, WPBookList will not be able to automatically pull information for your title. 

**Does it matter which ISBN number I use?** - Nope, WPBookList can find titles using both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, although using the ISBN-13 number is recommended. You can also leave dashes in the ISBN number when you're adding a book (for example, if you copy/paste from a different website).

**Can I upload my GoodReads library into WPBookList?** - You sure can, but only <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/goodreads-extension/">with the Goodreads Extension.</a>

**Why does it take so long to upload my Goodreads export?** - WPBookList is doing a ton of behind-the-scenes number-crunching for each title, reaching out to several different locations to gather all info possible about each title. As such, this can end up taking quite a while if your export is large… rest assured however that eventually, your entire Goodreads export will be uploaded!

**Why shouldn’t I open my Goodreads export file before uploading it to WordPress Book List?** - To ensure that nothing goes wrong with the upload process, the Goodreads export file must be in a ‘perfect state’ so to speak… sometimes, on some computers, simply opening the file can make modifications to it, depending on the operating system, the program used to open the file, etc. It’s just a much better idea to never open your Goodreads export and instead upload it straight to WordPress Book List.

**Do you provide support for WPBookList?** - Absolutely! If there's something just not right about your WPBookList experience, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:techsupport@wpbooklist.com">TechSupport@WPBookList.com</a>.  

**How do these StylePak things work?** - StylePaks are additional $2 add-ons for WPBookList that change the look and feel of WPBookList. Check out the StylePak Demos Here:

* <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/library-stylepak-1/">StylePak 1</a>
* <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/library-stylepak-2/">StylePak 2</a>

* <a href="http://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/library-stylepak-5/">StylePak 5</a>

**How do these Template Pak things work?** - Like StylePaks, Template Paks are additional $2 add-ons for WPBookList that change the look and feel of your WPBookList Pages and Posts. Check ‘em out Here:

* <a href="https://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/template-pak-1/">Template Pak 1</a>
* <a href="https://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/template-pak-2/">Template Pak 2</a>

* <a href="https://wpbooklist.com/index.php/downloads/template-pak-5/">Template Pak 5</a>

**What are all of the Shortcode Options for displaying a Cover Image?** - To display the cover image of a book that links to it’s Amazon page, simply place this shortcode on page or post: [showbookcover]. The available options are as follows:

* Specify a book: isbn="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
* Set placement: align="left" or align="right"
* Specify Library: table="nameoflibrary"
* Set the size: width="100"

So, for example, to display a book from a library you created named "fictionlibrary", on the left side of a page or post, with a size of 100, this shortcode would do the trick: 

[showbookcover isbn="123456789912" align="left" width="100" table="fictionlibrary"]

Simply leave out the table option to use the default library. 

If all options are left out of the [showbookcover] shortcode, by default WPBookList will display the first book from your default library, aligned to the left, with a size of 100. 

**How Can I Translate WPBookList Into My Language Of Choice?**
So here's the kinda-sorta official way to translate WPBookList:

Head to this link: <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpbooklist">https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpbooklist</a>

Scroll through the list to find the language and locale/dialect you want to translate WPBookList into, and click on the name. On the next page (which should look something like https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/de/formal/wp-plugins/wpbooklist) click on the "Stable (latest release)", and simply work your way down the list, translating string by string into whatever language you're working with. You'll have to be sure to be logged in (log in here: <a href="https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpbooklist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US">https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpbooklist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US</a>) before you can provide a translation.

Now when you add these translations, they'll be saved, and an official member of the WordPress translation team will have to 'approve' each one of these translations individually, and it's usually a first-come-first-served-type thing, meaning it could take quite a while. Luckily, you yourself can apply to be one of these "Official Translators", with the ability to approve your own translations.

In order to become one of these "Official Translators", I'll need to know your official username (the one you used to log in at <a href="https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpbooklist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US">https://login.wordpress.org/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.wordpress.org%2Fprojects%2Fwp-plugins%2Fwpbooklist%2Fstable%2Fde%2Fformal&locale=en_US</a>) and which specific language/dialect you're wanting to be an "Official Translator" of, and then I can send in a request. E-mail me those two bits of information to <a href="mailto:general@wpbooklist.com">general@wpbooklist.com</a>.
